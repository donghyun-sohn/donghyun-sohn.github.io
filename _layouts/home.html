          Hello! I'm Donghyun Sohn, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Northwestern University, working with 
          <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/" target="_blank">Professor Jennie Rogers</a>. 
          My research focuses on building secure and efficient data processing systems, especially at the intersection of databases and cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
          I develop practical query engines that support secure execution using cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). 
          My work tackles real-world challenges in private data analytics—ensuring that even sensitive queries can be executed efficiently without compromising security.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my core expertise lies in secure data infrastructure, I'm also broadly interested in making AI systems more efficient and resource-aware. 
          This includes optimizing the dataflow and execution of AI workloads, especially under privacy or deployment constraints. 
          I often explore how systems techniques—like query optimization, cost-based planning, and hardware-aware execution—can improve the performance and scalability of AI and analytics workloads alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about systems that actually run—my work is implemented in open-source projects and regularly evaluated on cloud environments like AWS. 
          I enjoy bridging research and practice, working across the full stack from low-level execution details to high-level design decisions.
