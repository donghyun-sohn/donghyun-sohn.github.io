          Hello, my name is Donghyun Sohn and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the computer science department at Northwestern University. 
          My research focus is on database systems, with a particular interest in security and privacy-preserving techniques using cryptography. 
          I am fortunate to have the opportunity to work with <a href = "http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/"></a>Prof. Jennie Rogers</a> as my advisor during my Ph.D. studies.
        </p>
        <p>My goal as a researcher is to make advancements in the field of databases that allow more people to confidently and efficiently analyze data, while also ensuring the trustworthiness of our systems. 
          I am excited to continue exploring this area of study and making a positive impact on the field.</p>
