### Notice

This posting is based on Prof. Vinod Vaikuntanathan's <b>MIT 6.875 Foundations of Cryptography (Fall 2021)</b> lecture. <br>

  In the last lecture, we get a new definition of security for secret-key encrytion that helps us overcome Shannon's lower bound. <br>
Also, we get new notion PRG, which allow us to encrypt a single message longer than the key. <br>
We saw candidate construction using the hardness of the subset sum problem. <br>

For today and next later, go deeper using PRG to encrypt better and better. <br>
