### Notice

This posting is based on Prof. Vinod Vaikuntanathan's <b>MIT 6.875 Foundations of Cryptography (Fall 2021)</b> lecture. <br>

### Recap 
  In the last lecture, we get a new definition of security for secret-key encrytion that helps us overcome Shannon's lower bound. <br>
Also, we get new notion PRG, which allow us to encrypt a single message longer than the key. <br>
We saw candidate construction using the hardness of the subset sum problem. <br>

For today and next later, go deeper using PRG to encrypt better and better. <br>

### Today
Two things today. 
1. PRG length extension 
2. Pseudorandom Functions 
Really important to know new proof technique : Hybrid Arguments <br>


### Three definitions of Pseudorandomness

Last time, we looked at the def 1. So today, we will look at def 2. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure3.png" width = "500"> <br>

For every ith bit, the guy cannot predict the ith bit given the first i-1 bits, the guy cannot predict it better than half. <br>

<b>Def 1 and Def 2 are Equivalent</b> <br>

A PRG G is indistinguishable if and only if it is next-bit unpredictable. <br>
A PRG G passes all (poly-time) statistical tests if and only if it passes (poly-time) next-bit tests. <br>
<b>What is important is Next-bit Unpredictability (NBU) is seemingly much weaker requirement, but NBU = Indistinguishability. Therefore NBU often much easier to use. </b> <br>

If you are interested in why indinstinguishability = NBU, watch the video. <br>

#### Our Predictor P
The idea : The predictor is given the first i-1 pseudorandom bits (call it y1y2, ... yi-1) and needs to guess the i-th bit. <br>

#### Analysis of the predictor P

$Pr[P(y1, ..., yi-1)=yi]>=1/2+1/p(n)$ <br>
We want the probability that P given y1 up to yi-1 predicts yi, and want this bigger than half + poly. <br>
$Pr[P(y1, ..., y-1)=yi] \; = \; Pr1[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 1 \, &b=yi]+Pr2[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 0 \, \and b\ne yi], where \; b \; is \; random \; bit$ <br>

Pr1 means that b, the bit that I fed him is the right bit and the guys say 1, then I will put b <br>
Pr2 means that b, the bit that I fed him is the wrong bit and the guys say 0, then I will take the b and flip it. <br>
  
$Pr[P(y1, ..., y-1)=yi] \; = \; Pr[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 1 \, |b=yi]*Pr[b=yi]+Pr[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 0 \, |b\ne yi]*Pr[b\neyi]$ <br>
$Pr[b=yi] = 1/2, Pr[b \ne yi]= 1/2$ , therefore <br>
$= 1/2(Pr[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 1 \, |b=yi]+Pr[D(y1,..yi-1 \, b \, ui+1, ... um) = 0 \, |b\ne yi])$ <br>
Like this, it follows the below equation. <br>

### Length extension : One bit to Many bits 

Let G: „Äñ{0,1}„Äó^ùëõ  ‚Üí„Äñ{0,1}„Äó^(ùëõ+1) be a pseudorandom generator. <br>
Goal: use G to generate poly many pseudorandom bits. <br> 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure6.png" width = "500"> <br>
First, we generate n+1 bit, which is y1. b1 is one bit, and s1 is last n bits. 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure7.png" width = "500"> <br>
This is called a <b>stream cipher</b>. You can stretch n bits to any polynomial bit. <br>
