### Recap 
  In the last lecture, we get a new definition of security for secret-key encrytion that helps us overcome Shannon's lower bound. <br>
Also, we get new notion PRG, which allow us to encrypt a single message longer than the key. <br>
We saw candidate construction using the hardness of the subset sum problem. <br>

For today and next later, go deeper using PRG to encrypt better and better. <br>

### Today
Two things today. 
1. PRG length extension 
2. Pseudorandom Functions <br>

Really important to know new proof technique : Hybrid Arguments <br>


### Three definitions of Pseudorandomness
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure2.png" width = "500"> <br>

Last time, we looked at the def 1. So today, we will look at def 2. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure3.png" width = "500"> <br>

For every ith bit, the guy cannot predict the ith bit when given the first i-1 bits, the guy cannot predict it better than half. <br>

<b>Def 1 and Def 2 are Equivalent</b> <br>

A PRG G is indistinguishable if and only if it is next-bit unpredictable. <br>
A PRG G passes all (poly-time) statistical tests if and only if it passes (poly-time) next-bit tests. <br>
<b>What is important is Next-bit Unpredictability (NBU) is seemingly much weaker requirement, but NBU = Indistinguishability. Therefore NBU often much easier to use. </b> <br>

If you are interested in why indinstinguishability = NBU, watch the video. <br>

#### Our Predictor P
The idea : The predictor is given the first i-1 pseudorandom bits (call it $y_{1} \, y_{2}, ... y_{i-1}$) and needs to guess the i-th bit. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure4.png" width = "500"> <br>

#### Analysis of the predictor P

$Pr[P(y_{1}, ..., y_{i-1})=y_{i}]>=1/2+1/p(n)$ <br>
We want the probability that P given y_{1} up to y_{i-1} predicts y_{i}, and want this bigger than half + poly. <br>
$Pr[P(y_{1}, ..., y_{i-1})=y_{i}] \; = \; Pr1[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 1 \, AND \; b=y_{i}]+Pr2[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 0 \, AND \; b\ne y_{i}], where \; b \; is \; random \; bit$ <br>

Pr1 means that b, the bit that I fed him is the right bit and the guys say 1, then I will put b <br>
Pr2 means that b, the bit that I fed him is the wrong bit and the guys say 0, then I will take the b and flip it. <br>
  
$Pr[P(y_{1}, ..., y_{i-1})=y_{i}] \; = \; Pr[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 1 \, |b=y_{i}]*Pr[b=y_{i}]+Pr[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 0 \, |b\ne y_{i}]*Pr[b \ne y_{i}]$ <br>
$Pr[b=y_{i}] = 1/2, Pr[b \ne y_{i}]= 1/2$ , therefore <br>
$= 1/2(Pr[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 1 \, |b=y_{i}]+Pr[D(y_{1},..y_{i-1} \, b \, u_{i+1}, ... u_{m}) = 0 \, |b\ne y_{i}])$ <br>
Like this, it follows the below equation. <br>

### Length extension : One bit to Many bits 

Let $G: \left\{0,1\right\}^ùëõ ‚Üí\left\{0,1\right\}^{ùëõ+1}$ be a pseudorandom generator. <br>
Goal: use G to generate poly many pseudorandom bits. <br> 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure6.png" width = "500"> <br>
First, we generate $n+1$ bit, which is $y_{1}$. $b_{1}$ is one bit, and $s_{1}$ is last $n$ bits. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure7.png" width = "500"> <br>
You output the one bit and keep the last n bits. And then apply the PRG again. If you keep doing this process, you can get the figure below. 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure8.png" width = "500"> <br>
Like this, you can get the any length that you want. Output is the concatenation of this. 
This is called a <b>stream cipher</b>. You can stretch n bits to any polynomial bit. <br>

#### Stateful Encryption of Many Messages. 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure9.png" width = "500"> <br>
Alice wants to send 1-bit message m, so she used PRG to get b1 and used it for one-time pad. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure10.png" width = "500"> <br>
Now, their current state are s1. We do not want to use b1 again, because we do not want to use one-time pad again. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure11.png" width = "500"> <br>
Let's assume that Alice wants to send 3-bit message, so she runs the 3 steps.<br> 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure12.png" width = "500"> <br>
So when we encrypt many messages, then Alice and Bob need to keep states. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure13.png" width = "500"> <br>
There are some drawbacks of using stateful encryption. Can we make it to be stateless? <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure14.png" width = "500"> <br>
Use the PRG for huge polynomial times and write down all of this. And pick random index and use corresponding bit for one-time pad. 
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure15.png" width = "500"> <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure16.png" width = "500"> <br>
Use the PRG for very huge length.   
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure17.png" width = "500"> <br>
We can get some points of aforementioned idea. <br>
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure18.png" width = "500"> <br>

### Pseudorandom Functions
<img src = "./lecture_3/figure19.png" width = "500"> <br>

<img src = "./lecture_3/figure20.png" width = "500"> <br>
We want these two functions to be indistinguishable. <br>

<img src = "./lecture_3/figure21.png" width = "500"> <br>

<img src = "./lecture_3/figure22.png" width = "500"> <br>
Comparing with before, encryption scheme is changed. One-time pad and all the other encryption schemes that we used were deterministic. They had the key and the process was deterministic. But this encryption now is randomized encryption. <br>
